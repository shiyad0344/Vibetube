This project is a backend project that is built with nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, jwt, bcrypt. This project is a complete backend project that has all the features that a backend project should have.I built a complete video hosting website similar to youtube with all the features like login, signup, upload video, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more.

Project uses all standard practices like JWT, bcrypt, access tokens, refresh Tokens and many more.
A hybrid model of Twitter and YouTube. Still, a few tweaks to make. Still under production, I have to add tweet functionalities.
